# Personal website from HTML/CSS only

During the HTML/CSS basics course I built a website that presents my resume in a creative way :).\

## You are welcome to take a look at my very first steps in HTML/CSS :)

This project was fun, and every time I want to have fun or practice CSS I'll come back here.\

**Note: At some point I exhausted the use of only HTML and progressed to learn JavaScript,
so you can find some buttons that will not lead you anywhere >< look for them ;)*
